        <p>Interviewer: Bomi Err<br>
            <span style="color: #cc0000;">Interviewee: Jenny Zee, 17 years old</span>
        </p>
        <p>Bomi Err: How do you use the internet in your daily life?            <br>
            <span style="color: #cc0000;">Jenny Zee: Well, I use the internet probably every single day. Like I have to use it for all my assignments at school and I’m pretty screwed if I don’t have my Chromebook for any of my classes. I also spend a lot of time on the Internet at home. My homework is online and I spend a solid couple of hours doomscrolling on TikTok and Instagram. I also spend time texting friends after school and whatnot, so the internet plays a big part in my life.            </span>
        </p>
        <p>BE: How much time would you say you spend online?            <br>
            <span style="color: #cc0000;">JZ: Maybe a couple of hours? It’s a lot considering the time I spend doing homework and on social media. Wait let me check the screen time on my phone since it has a feature that lets me see how much time I’ve spent on it. Yeah, wait um it might be a little more than a few hours. I’ve been spending 8 hours a day on my phone in the last week. But that sometimes includes when my screen is on while my music is playing so it’s not that bad. I swear I sleep more than I spend on my phone.            </span>
        </p>
        <p>BE: How do you think your internet use affects you?            <br>
            <span style="color: #cc0000;">JZ: Well, attention span is definitely a big one. I used to be an avid reader growing up. I was that one kid who would read four Harry Potter books in a day and spend all day reading. I also used to stay up reading when I got invested in a book. It’s pretty different now. I haven’t found time to pick up a book in ages and even when I sit down to read, I can only get through a couple of pages before my mind starts drifting elsewhere or I simply get bored with the book. Yeah, I also have a hard time focusing on pretty much anything school-related. I always feel like I need to check my email or look at my phone, especially when I get a notification. I don’t want to miss anything important.            </span>
        </p>
        <p>BE: Would you want to spend less time on the internet?            <br>
            <span style="color: #cc0000;">JZ: Yes, that’s definitely a goal of mine. I’ve been trying to spend more time socializing and spending time outside. I really do want to not use my phone as often but I also can’t delete any of my social media apps because I use them to message my friends. I have several apps to limit my screen time and restrict apps after a certain time, but they don’t work as well as I want to, and I always worry I’ll miss something important.            </span>
        </p>
        <p>BE: That’s all of the questions for now. Thank you for your time, Jenny.
        </p>
