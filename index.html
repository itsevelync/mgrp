        <p class="lead">As we navigate life through a whirlwind of technological innovations and the increased interconnectivity of the internet, it’s clear that society has had to adapt to accommodate the hours and hours we spend online each day. In many ways, technology has been a beneficial assistant to daily tasks, streamlining so much of what we do. The current generation of teens grew up with iPhones and Chromebooks, and many of us, including me, can’t envision life without these devices. However, all innovations have drawbacks, and the internet also has dangerous impacts.</p>
        <p class="lead">This multi-genre work explores the influence of prolonged internet use on the human brain. It includes an interview with Jenny Zee, an avid social media user, to help understand teens’ internet habits. I’ve also drawn a satirical comic displaying the results of internet addiction on something as simple of a family dinner. The project also includes an obituary, much like one you would find in a local newspaper, mourning the death of Attention Span as a result of prolonged internet use. Finally, the project is housed on a website fraught with distracting components to represent how distracting the internet can be. It contains ads that parody real advertisements from tech companies and social media apps that demonstrate some of the underlying mechanisms behind the products to keep us addicted. It also has elements that fly across the screen and annoying popups that appear every few seconds.</p>
        <p class="lead">This project is a culmination of information from research and personal experience to paint a picture of the effects of internet use. It aims to give teens a little more self-awareness of their internet use habits and hopefully will remind people of the importance of touching grass every once in a while.</p>
